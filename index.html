							<li><i><a HREF="http://www.treccast.ai/">Conversational assistance track TREC</a></i></li>
							For my masters thesis, I studied how <a HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> could be used in a multi-turn artificial conversational setting. It was great learning experience to join a conference track and to be working with a state-of-the-art NLP technique on a complex problem.<br><br>
							<li><i>Legal relevance classification</i></li>
							Legal relevance classification of dutch corpora. Near perfect performance in both the supervised and unsupervised approach. Suspicion of data leakage even after thorough examination of variables. 
							The source code and research paper can be found on <a HREF="https://github.com/TanjaCrijns/Text-mining-final-project">Github</a>.<br><br>
							<li><i>Kaggle competitions</i></li>
							I have participated in the Kaggle competition 'The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring' together with a team. The task was to automatically categorise images that may or may not contain 
							certain types of fish. There are eight categories.
							We ended the competition in the top 6%. A github repository of our project can be found <a HREF="https://github.com/TanjaCrijns/MLIP-BigAITuna">here</a>.<br><br>
							We also participated in the Kaggle competition 'Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space'. The objective here was to classify which ground types (forest, cultivation etc.) are present 
							in patches of a satellite image. 
							We approached the problem with deep learning techniques and finished the challenge in the top 12%. A github repository of our project can be found 
							<a HREF="https://github.com/TanjaCrijns/MLIP-Brainforest">here</a>.<br><br>
							<li><i>Microbleed detection</i></li>
							For a medical imaging course, I researched the use of deep learning in the detection of cerebral microbleeds in Traumatic Brain Injury patients. We used a two-step deep learning approach;
							 segmentation and classification. I co-authored the paper that was written on this topic and it was accepted at 
							the <a HREF="http://spie.org/MI/conferencedetails/computer-aided-diagnosis?SSO=1#session-10">SPIE Medical conference in 2017</a> (session 10).
